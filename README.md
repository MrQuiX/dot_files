# Dot Files for `onboardme`

These started as my personal dot files, but then they became the sensible
 defaults for `onboardme`, what started out as a script to manage my dot files.
 Funny how these things work. :shrug:

 Below you'll find sections for each config file, organized by how they show up in github.


<details>
  <summary>`.config`</summary>

  Below are directories that would be located in your home directory, under `.config`.

  ## `asciinema`
  File: [~/.config/asciinema/config](.config/asciinema/config)

  Local config file for [`asciinema`](https://asciinema.org/), a lightweight, purely text-based approach to terminal recording. Currently it just sets the shell command to be `/bin/bash --login`, which loads your bash variables. This could be changed to a different shell and their equivilent.

  ## gh
  File: [`~/.config/gh`](.config/gh/config.yml)

  Local config file for [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/), the GitHub CLI. There's not a ton in there, but it uses [`rich-cli`](https://github.com/Textualize/rich-cli) as a prettier pager, and firefox as a browser, and setting vim as an editor. The rest is stock, and subject to change.

  ## glab-cli
  File: [`~/.config/glab-cli`](.config/glab-cli/config.yml)

  Local config file for [`glab`](https://glab-cli.io/), an open source GitLab CLI tool. There's not a ton in there, but it uses a dark theme, firefox as a browser, and vim as an editor.  The rest is stock, and subject to change.
